# BWN-Spline

A VB.Net program for draw BWN-Spline curve based on [1]. This program is part of my M.Sc. thesis in applied mathematics in IUST. User can open a picture in background and insert some point around picture to automaticaly draw curve. Besides, every point and line can get their weights to fit picture. Graphical user interface has designed to users can easily draw, modify, and save figures.
